# Data-Fest-2019

I participated in the 2019 Data Fest competition at Case Western. The basic rules of the project was that we had 2 days to analyze a mystery data set. We had to work in groups of 2-5 and could use any any tools to analyze the data (our group used R and a little bit of excel). At the end of the 2 days we had to submit a 2 slide presentation and anaccompaning 1 page report with whatever insight we came up with. We then presented our findings to a panel of judges.

The data set for the datafes was health, spacial, and game data for the Canadian Women's Rugby team. Our problem statement was to find a way to improve game/tournament performance. We looked mainly at 2 things: predicting how soon the team arrives before a tournament and their performance and creating a model to determine when a player is at high risk for injury. Presentation.pdf and Report.pdf are our submissions to the panel and Datafest.rmd is the code used to explore the data and create visualizations/models (it's not well structured or labeled cause of the short time frame). We received an honorable mention for our attempt to predict flight dates.
