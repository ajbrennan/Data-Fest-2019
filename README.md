# Data-Fest-2019

I participated in the 2019 Data Fest competition at Case Western. The basic rules of the project was that we had 2 days to analyze a mystery data set. We had to work in groups of 2-5 and could use any any tools to analyze the data (our group used R and a little bit of excel). At the end of the 2 days we had to submit a 2 slide presentation and anaccompaning 1 page report with whatever insight we came up with. We then presented our findings to a panel of judges.
